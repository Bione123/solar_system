This is a simulation of a solar system made with processing.
Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code. It uses simplified Java language to encourage people to learn programming.
It is open source and free to download, full of tutorials and reference pages.

Setup
---------
Every processing project need two functions: 
```
void setup(){

}
void draw(){

}
```
These are the two main functions, and then you're ready to code!

OOP - Object Oriented Programming
---------

Processing uses Java, which is powerful because of the OOP.

For the most part, OOP is advantageous because it allows you to re-use blocks of code without re-writing them

I created a class "Planet" with some properties such as radius, distance from the sun, and angles, as well as methods, such as the constructor function that creates instances of the class, for example

```
class Planet {
 
 // some properties
  
  Planet(float r, float d, float o){
    // some stuff
  }
  
  // other methods
  
  // creating instances of the class
  sun = new Planet(float r, float d, float o);
  
}
```
